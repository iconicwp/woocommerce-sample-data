# WooCommerce Sample Data

WooCommerce comes with a limited number of sample products. I spent a while searching for a larger data set and came across this one: https://glover.us/blog/woocommerce-sample-data-set/

After importing the data via **Products** > **Import**, I was satisfied with the results. 

This repo aims to enhance the discoverability of this sample data, and open it up for contributions.

## How to Use

1. Download the `woocommerce-sample-data.csv` file.
2. Naviagte to **Products** > **Import**.
3. Select the downloaded CSV file.
4. Double-check the suggested mappings, though they should be fine by default.
5. Click "Import" and wait.
